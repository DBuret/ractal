.explanation
Allocate memory for output image of given width and height with ImageBuffer::new. Rgb::from_channels calculates RGB pixel values. Create ThreadPool with thread count equal to number of cores with num_cpus::get. ThreadPool::execute receives each pixel as a separate job.

mpsc::channel receives the jobs and Receiver::recv retrieves them. ImageBuffer::put_pixel uses the data to set the pixel color. ImageBuffer::save writes the image to output.png.

=== complex numbers

[source,rust]
----
extern crate num;

fn main() {
    let complex_num1 = num::complex::Complex::new(10.0, 20.0); // Must use floats
    let complex_num2 = num::complex::Complex::new(3.1, -4.2);

    let sum = complex_num1 + complex_num2;

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
